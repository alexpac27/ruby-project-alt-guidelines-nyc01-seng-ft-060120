Flatiron Food Ordering App
========================

Welcome to the Flatiron Food Order App! This is a food ordering app, similar to Grubhub and Seamless, that will allow you to place food orders from your favorite restaurants. The app allows you to register as a new user or log in to an existing account. Once in your account, you can do any of the following:

*  Create a new order
*  View latest order
*  Update last order
*  Cancel last order
*  View order history
* Update username
* Exit the app



### Installation

Before you can run the app, please follow the installation steps below:

* Run 'bundle install' to ensure that you have all of the necessary gems.
* Run 'rake db:migrate' to migrate all of the necessary tables.
* Run 'rake db:seed' to activate the data for the app.
* Finally, to run the app, type 'ruby ./bin/run.rb' in your terminal.


### Presentation Notes

During the creation of our project, common hurdles included:

* Ensuring that our code was abstract enouch to avoid confusion.
* Making sure that whenever we made changes to a record in the database, that we were using the appropriate AR commands to save the data.
* Identifying opportunities for recursion and properly updating the code to fit the recursion choices.

Additional changes we would like to make to the app include:

* Further abstraction
* Adding a Driver model and expanding on our Restaurant user stories
* Implementing APIs for seed data (in moderation)
* Adding functionality of tty prompt to make the UX more streamlined


Highlights include:
    
* Login method and register method
    - the use of recursion to ensure correct registration and proper access to database records
* Dealing with errors from the user input
    - using .titleize to eliminate errors between the database and user input
    - using recursion and clear messages to guide the user down a correct path
